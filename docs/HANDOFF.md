# LEGACY: Session Handoff - RecapMCP

**⚠️ NOTE**: This is a legacy handoff file. Going forward, create handoffs as Claude artifacts, not files.

**Date**: 2025-06-25
**Session Duration**: 10:00 AM - 10:45 AM PST
**Main Goal**: Create comprehensive project documentation & update roadmap
**Outcome**: Successfully created PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md, essential docs, and refocused roadmap on Unified Mode

## Recent Update
- Added CRITICAL section about DesktopCommanderMCP-Recap integration rules
- Specified that ONLY trackTools.ts can be modified
- Clarified that all other files in DesktopCommanderMCP-Recap are READ-ONLY
- **MAJOR CHANGE**: Updated ROADMAP.md to focus exclusively on Unified Mode implementation
- Unified Mode: ONE intelligent mode with ZERO parameters (except hours)

## Current State

### Branch Information
```bash
Current Branch: main
Status: Up to date with origin/main
Last Commit: [pending] "docs: add comprehensive project documentation"
```

### Files Created
1. `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete project instructions with TDD workflow

### 2. Essential Documentation
- [x] Created docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md with solutions
- [x] Created docs/CHANGELOG.md with version history
- [x] Created docs/ROADMAP.md with future plans
- [x] Set up proper documentation structure
- [x] **Updated ROADMAP.md**: Now focused solely on Unified Mode implementation
## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### CRITICAL PRIORITY: Implement Unified Mode (v3.0.0)
1. **Simplify types.ts**:
   - Remove all format/mode parameters
   - Keep only `hours` parameter
   ```typescript
   export const RecapArgsSchema = z.object({
     hours: z.number().min(1).max(168).default(24)
   });
   ```

2. **Create generateUnifiedRecap()**:
   - Combine best features from all modes
   - Smart context detection
   - Adaptive output based on work pattern

3. **Remove Legacy Code**:
   - Delete all format-specific functions
   - Remove parameter handling logic
   - Clean up unnecessary complexity

### After Unified Mode:
1. Write comprehensive tests for unified output
2. Update all documentation to remove mode references
3. Create migration guide for users

## Code Context

### Current Working State:
```typescript
// No code changes were made in this session
// Focus was on documentation
// All existing code remains unchanged
```

### Areas Needing Attention:
1. Test coverage for recovery.ts module
2. Error handling in large log scenarios
3. Memory optimization for streaming
4. Windows-specific path handling

## Configuration Notes

### Environment Setup:
- Node.js 18+ required
- TypeScript 5.3+ for strict mode
- Enhanced DesktopCommanderMCP-Recap needed
- Claude Desktop integration configured

### Key Files to Review:
- `/src/recap.ts` - Core analysis logic
- `/src/recovery.ts` - Recovery mode implementation  
- `/src/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces
- `/test/` - Existing test structure

## Known Issues & Blockers

1. **Major Architecture Change Pending**:
   - Moving to Unified Mode (v3.0.0)
   - Will remove all format parameters
   - Requires significant code refactoring

2. **No Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Need to establish test structure
   - Missing integration tests
   - No coverage reporting

3. **Documentation Will Need Updates**:
   - API documentation will be obsolete after Unified Mode
   - README needs complete rewrite
   - All mode references must be removed

## Git Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Start where you left off
git status
git add -A
git commit -m "docs: add comprehensive project documentation"
git push origin main

# For next feature
git checkout -b feature/comprehensive-tests
npm test
```

## Session Metrics
- Files created: 6
- Files updated: 3 (PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md, ROADMAP.md, HANDOFF.md)
- Documentation pages: 5
- Total lines written: ~1000
- Major decision: Unified Mode as sole roadmap priority
- Test coverage: Not measured (no tests written)
- Time spent: 45 minutes

## Questions for Next Session
1. Should we maintain backward compatibility during transition to Unified Mode?
2. How to handle users who specifically request JSON output?
3. Should the unified output adapt its length based on session complexity?
4. Do we need a feature flag to test Unified Mode before full release?
5. How to migrate existing documentation to reflect single-mode approach?

---

**Remember for next session**:
1. All documentation is now in `/docs` folder
2. Follow TDD workflow for any code changes
3. No scattered documentation outside `/docs`
4. Check PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md for workflow
5. Review KNOWN_ISSUES.md before debugging
