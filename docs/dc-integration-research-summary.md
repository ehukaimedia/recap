# Desktop Commander Integration Research Summary

## How Tools Integrate with trackTools.ts

### 1. **Central Integration Point**
All Desktop Commander tools flow through a single point in `server.ts`:
```typescript
server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  const {name, arguments: args} = request.params;
  
  // This is where EVERY tool call is tracked
  trackToolCall(name, args);
  
  // Then tool execution happens...
});
```

### 2. **Available Tools and Their Data**

#### File System Tools
- **read_file**: `{path, offset?, length?}`
- **write_file**: `{path, content, mode}`
- **list_directory**: `{path}`
- **create_directory**: `{path}`
- **move_file**: `{source, destination}`
- **get_file_info**: `{path}`

#### Edit Tools  
- **edit_block**: `{file_path, old_string, new_string, expected_replacements?}`

#### Search Tools
- **search_files**: `{path, pattern, timeoutMs?}`
- **search_code**: `{path, pattern, contextLines?, filePattern?, ...}`

#### Execution Tools
- **execute_command**: `{command, timeout_ms, shell?}`
- **read_output**: `{pid, timeout_ms?}`
- **force_terminate**: `{pid}`

#### Process Tools
- **list_processes**: `{}`
- **kill_process**: `{pid}`

### 3. **Current Data Extraction**

trackTools.ts currently extracts:
- Tool name and timestamp
- Full arguments object
- Session management (15-minute timeout)
- File paths from various argument fields
- Working directory from absolute paths
- Workflow patterns from tool sequences
- Intent detection from patterns and arguments

### 4. **Missing Recovery Data**

What we DON'T capture but COULD:

1. **Command Results**
   - Currently tracked BEFORE execution completes
   - Missing: success/failure, exit codes, error messages
   - Missing: command duration and output size

2. **Edit Context**
   - Have: old_string, new_string
   - Missing: edit size/ratio analysis
   - Missing: code pattern detection (function/class/import)
   - Missing: approximate line numbers

3. **Operation Relationships**
   - Have: sequential tool calls
   - Missing: logical operation chains
   - Missing: incomplete task detection
   - Missing: verification tracking

4. **File Metadata**
   - Have: file paths
   - Missing: file sizes, types, access frequency
   - Missing: hot file detection

5. **Search Evolution**
   - Have: individual searches
   - Missing: search refinement patterns
   - Missing: search-to-action correlation

## Proposed Enhancements for Recovery

### 1. **Operation Chain Tracking**
```typescript
// Detect incomplete workflows
"search_code" → "read_file" → "edit_block" → [MISSING: "execute_command:test"]
```

### 2. **Pending Verification System**
```typescript
// Track what needs validation
{
  tool: "edit_block",
  file: "auth.js",
  timestamp: "2m ago",
  needs: "test execution"
}
```

### 3. **Enhanced Edit Analysis**
```typescript
{
  editSize: 150,        // characters changed
  editRatio: 1.2,       // growth factor
  pattern: "function",  // what type of code
  operation: "modify"   // create/modify/delete
}
```

### 4. **File Activity Heatmap**
```typescript
{
  "auth.js": { accesses: 5, lastModified: "2m ago" },
  "test.js": { accesses: 3, lastModified: "5m ago" }
}
```

### 5. **Recovery Checkpoints**
Automatic state saves triggered by:
- Every 10 operations
- After critical commands
- When operation chains complete
- Every 5 minutes of activity

## Impact on Recovery Mode

### Before Enhancement
Recovery shows:
- Last tool used
- Files accessed
- Basic pending operations

### After Enhancement
Recovery shows:
- Complete operation chains with missing steps
- Specific files needing test verification
- Edit scope and impact analysis
- Search investigation progress
- Hot files indicating focus areas
- Time-based checkpoint restoration

### Example Enhanced Recovery Output
```
QUICK RECOVERY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Last Activity: 2 minutes ago
Working On: Authentication Module

INCOMPLETE OPERATION CHAIN:
Started: Search for "undefined token" (15m ago)
Progress: search_code → read_file → edit_block
Missing: Test execution to verify fix

PENDING VERIFICATIONS (3):
• auth.js - Modified 2m ago, needs testing
• middleware.js - Modified 5m ago, needs testing  
• config.json - Modified 8m ago, needs validation

HOT FILES (by activity):
1. auth.js (5 accesses)
2. auth.test.js (3 accesses)
3. middleware.js (2 accesses)

EDIT IMPACT ANALYSIS:
• auth.js: +150 chars (1.2x growth) - Added function
• middleware.js: -50 chars (0.8x) - Refactored code

SEARCH EVOLUTION:
"undefined" → "undefined token" → "jwt undefined"
(Shows investigation narrowing to JWT issue)

SUGGESTED RECOVERY ACTIONS:
1. Run: npm test auth.test.js (verify auth.js changes)
2. Review: JWT token validation in middleware.js
3. Complete: Operation chain by running tests
4. Commit: 3 pending file changes
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Add operation chain and verification tracking
2. **Phase 2**: Enhance edit and file metadata
3. **Phase 3**: Implement checkpoint system
4. **Phase 4**: Add search evolution tracking

All changes isolated to trackTools.ts, maintaining system integrity while dramatically improving recovery intelligence.

## Conclusion

The Desktop Commander integration is elegantly simple - all tools funnel through one tracking point. By enhancing trackTools.ts with recovery-focused data extraction, we can provide Claude with a much richer context for resuming interrupted work, without modifying any other files in the system.
