# Recovery Mode Example: Current vs Enhanced

## Scenario: Developer Debugging Authentication Error

A developer was debugging a JWT authentication issue when Claude timed out. They had:
1. Searched for "undefined token" errors
2. Found the issue in auth middleware
3. Started fixing the validation logic
4. Got interrupted before testing

PENDING OPERATIONS:
• File edited but not tested

UNCOMMITTED FILES:

SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS:
1. Test changes to /Users/dev/projects/ecommerce-api/src/auth/middleware.js
2. Review and commit /Users/dev/projects/ecommerce-api/src/auth/middleware.js
```

### Problems with Current Output:
- ❌ Doesn't show WHAT was being debugged
- ❌ No context about the error being fixed
- ❌ Generic "test changes" suggestion
- ❌ No indication of investigation progress
- ❌ Doesn't show related files that were examined

🔴 QUICK RECOVERY - Authentication Debug Session
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⏱️ Session Duration: 45 minutes (interrupted 3m ago)
🎯 Intent: Debug JWT token validation error (confidence: 85%)
📁 Working On: E-commerce API - Authentication Module

🔍 INVESTIGATION PROGRESS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Search Evolution (narrowing the issue):
1. "undefined" → Found 47 matches (too broad)
2. "undefined token" → Found 8 matches (getting warmer)
3. "jwt undefined" → Found 2 matches (found it!)

Key Discovery: JWT token validation in middleware.js line ~127
Pattern: Missing null check before token.split('.')

🔧 INCOMPLETE OPERATION CHAIN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
auth-debug-session-x7y2 (85% complete):

✅ search_code "jwt undefined" in /src
✅ read_file auth/middleware.js (found issue at line 127)  
✅ read_file tests/auth.test.js (checked existing tests)
✅ edit_block middleware.js (added null check)
❌ execute_command "npm test auth" (NOT RUN - NEEDS VERIFICATION)
❌ git commit (NOT DONE - Changes uncommitted)

📝 CHANGES MADE (Uncommitted)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
File: src/auth/middleware.js
Change Size: +87 characters (added 4 lines)
Edit Type: Defensive null check added
Code Pattern: Validation function enhancement

Before:
```javascript
const parts = token.split('.');
if (parts.length !== 3) {
```

After:
```javascript
if (!token || typeof token !== 'string') {
  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token format' });
}
const parts = token.split('.');
if (parts.length !== 3) {
```

Related Files Examined:
• auth/jwt-utils.js (3 reads) - Checked token generation
• tests/auth.test.js (2 reads) - Reviewed test coverage
• config/auth.js (1 read) - Verified JWT secret config

📊 FILE ACTIVITY HEATMAP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔥 Hot Files (most accessed):
1. middleware.js     - 7 accesses (main focus)
2. auth.test.js     - 4 accesses (test verification)
3. jwt-utils.js     - 3 accesses (token generation)
4. error-logs.txt   - 2 accesses (error investigation)

⚠️ NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Untested Code Change - The null check fix hasn't been tested
2. Missing Test Case - No test for null token scenario
3. Uncommitted Changes - 1 file modified 3 minutes ago

🎯 SPECIFIC RECOVERY ACTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. First, verify the fix works:
   ```bash
   npm test src/auth/middleware.test.js
   ```

2. Add test case for null token (in auth.test.js):
   ```javascript
   it('should reject null or undefined tokens', async () => {
     const res = await request(app)
       .get('/protected')
       .set('Authorization', 'Bearer null');
     expect(res.status).toBe(401);
     expect(res.body.error).toBe('Invalid token format');
   });
   ```

3. Run full auth test suite:
   ```bash
   npm test -- --testPathPattern=auth
   ```

4. If tests pass, commit with context:
   ```bash
   git add src/auth/middleware.js
   git commit -m "fix: Add null check for JWT token validation

   - Prevents TypeError when token is null/undefined
   - Returns 401 with clear error message
   - Fixes issue discovered via 'jwt undefined' search"
   ```

5. Consider adding similar defensive checks in:
   - jwt-utils.js (token generation)
   - refresh-token.js (if exists)

💡 CONTEXT FROM INTENT ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Evidence of debugging workflow:
• Error-related search terms detected
• Test file examination pattern
• Focused investigation on auth module
• Quick fix implementation (defensive coding)

This appears to be a production bug fix based on:
• Urgency of investigation (45-minute session)
• Direct jump to middleware after error search
• Defensive coding pattern applied

## Why This Enhanced Output is Superior

### 1. **Complete Context Recovery**
- Shows WHAT was being debugged (JWT validation)
- Shows HOW the issue was found (search evolution)
- Shows WHERE the problem was (line 127, missing null check)
- Shows WHAT was changed (exact code diff)

### 2. **Actionable Intelligence**
- Specific test commands to run
- Exact test case to add
- Proper commit message with context
- Related files that might need similar fixes

### 3. **Progress Visualization**
- Operation chain shows what's done ✅ and what's missing ❌
- File heatmap shows investigation focus
- Search evolution shows debugging thought process

### 4. **Risk Awareness**
- Highlights untested code changes
- Points out missing test coverage
- Shows uncommitted work at risk

### 5. **True Session Continuity**
Instead of generic "test your changes", it provides:
- The exact test command for the specific module
- A ready-to-use test case for the bug
- Context-aware commit message
- Follow-up improvements based on the pattern

This is what proper recovery looks like - not just "you edited a file", but complete reconstruction of the debugging session with specific, contextual next steps.
