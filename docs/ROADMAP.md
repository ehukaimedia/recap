## 🚀 Future Vision - v3.x and Beyond

### 🎯 v3.1.0 - Natural Language Intelligence (Q3 2025)

**Goal**: Allow natural language filtering without breaking zero-configuration principle

**Features:**
- **Smart Project Filtering**: `recap my API work` → Shows only API project activity
- **Workflow Filtering**: `recap debugging` → Shows only debugging sessions
- **Time Understanding**: `recap this morning` → Intelligent time parsing
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn user's natural language patterns

**Implementation:**
- Optional natural language parameter that doesn't complicate the API
- Maintains `recap` with no parameters as default
- Uses intent detection patterns from trackTools.ts

### 🧩 v3.2.0 - Enhanced Project Intelligence (Q4 2025)

**Goal**: Better multi-project and monorepo support

**Features:**
- **Project Relationship Mapping**: Understand when docs relate to code projects
- **Monorepo Intelligence**: Detect package boundaries in monorepos
- **Cross-Project Dependencies**: Show how changes in one project affect others
- **Smart Project Switching**: Detect intentional vs accidental context switches

**Benefits:**
- More accurate project grouping
- Better context preservation across related projects
- Reduced noise from accidental directory traversals

### 👥 v3.3.0 - Team Awareness (Q1 2026)

**Goal**: Optional team features while maintaining privacy

**Features:**
- **Shared Project Detection**: Know when working on team projects
- **Handoff Generation**: Create detailed handoffs for teammates
- **Conflict Awareness**: Warn about files others are editing
- **Team Patterns**: Learn team-specific workflows

**Privacy First:**
- All features opt-in
- Local analysis only
- No data leaves the machine unless explicitly shared

### ⚡ v3.4.0 - Performance & Scale (Q2 2026)

**Goal**: Handle massive codebases and long work sessions

**Features:**
- **Incremental Log Processing**: Only parse new entries
- **Smart Log Rotation**: Automatic archival of old sessions
- **Memory Optimization**: Stream processing for large logs
- **Instant Startup**: Cache recent analysis

**Targets:**
- < 50ms response time for any time range
- Handle 1M+ tool calls efficiently
- Minimal memory footprint

### 🎨 v3.5.0 - Visual Intelligence (Q3 2026)

**Goal**: Richer visual representations

**Features:**
- **Activity Timeline**: Visual timeline of work sessions
- **Project Flow Diagram**: Show how you moved between projects
- **Heat Calendar**: GitHub-style contribution graph for productivity
- **Focus Metrics**: Visual representation of deep work sessions

**Implementation:**
- Terminal-friendly ASCII visualizations
- Optional HTML export for richer visuals
- Maintains text-first approach

### 🔮 v4.0.0 - Predictive Intelligence (2027)

**Goal**: Anticipate needs before asking

**Features:**
- **Proactive Suggestions**: "You usually test after edits like this"
- **Pattern Learning**: Personal workflow optimization
- **Smart Defaults**: Adjust time ranges based on work patterns
- **Anomaly Detection**: "This is unusual for your workflow"

**Philosophy:**
- Still zero configuration
- Intelligence that feels natural
- Never intrusive or prescriptive

## 📋 Development Principles (Unchanged)

1. **Zero Configuration First**: Every feature must work without setup
2. **Intelligent Defaults**: Smart choices that users don't see
3. **Speed Matters**: Never slow down the user's workflow
4. **Visual Clarity**: Information hierarchy that scans instantly
5. **Backwards Compatible**: Never break existing usage

## 🚫 What We'll Never Do

- ❌ Add required parameters
- ❌ Create configuration files
- ❌ Make users choose formats
- ❌ Complicate the simple `recap` command
- ❌ Sacrifice simplicity for features

**Vision**: RecapMCP should feel like a thoughtful colleague who always knows exactly what context you need, without you having to ask.

**Next Milestone**: v3.1.0 - Natural Language Intelligence
