## 🚧 Remaining Work

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Enhanced)
1. **RecapMCP Integration**
   * Emit structured logs compatible with DesktopCommanderMCP
   * Include rich context for each command execution
   * Enable pattern analysis by recap tool
   * Create bidirectional intelligence without hard dependencies
2. **Intelligent Command Suggestions**
   * Analyze recap data to suggest next commands
   * Detect patterns like "test after code changes"
   * Time-based suggestions (EOD builds, morning tests)
   * Error recovery suggestions
3. **Enhanced Workflow Tracking**
   * Track command sequences as workflows
   * Identify common command chains
   * Learn project-specific patterns
   * Suggest workflow automation
4. **Context-Aware Features**
   * Command history and patterns
   * Intelligent error recovery
   * Performance monitoring
   * Rich output formatting

#### Implementation Approach
The run tool will emit logs in the DesktopCommanderMCP format:

```
[timestamp] | recap:run | {contextInfo} | Args: {command details}
```

This allows recap to analyze:
* Which commands are run most frequently
* Common command sequences
* Error patterns and recovery actions
* Time-based usage patterns

The integration is designed to be loosely coupled - both tools remain independently useful but become more powerful when used together.

#### Technical Debt
* Add integration tests for actual command execution
* Improve TypeScript types for better type safety
* Add logging for debugging
* Consider configuration file support

## Overview

A truly intuitive, zero-configuration script runner that works seamlessly across all platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux) and supports multiple languages (Node.js, Python, and extensible to others).

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Configuration** - Works immediately without any setup
2. **Context Aware** - Automatically detects project type and location
3. **Platform Agnostic** - Handles OS differences transparently
4. **Language Neutral** - Extensible architecture for any language
5. **Intelligent Defaults** - Makes smart decisions without user input

## Architecture Design

### 1. Project Context Detection ✅

**Automatic Working Directory Resolution** ✅
- ✅ Use MCP's file system access to determine actual project location
- ✅ Traverse up from Claude's context to find project root
- ⬜ Cache project locations per session
- ⬜ Support multiple open projects simultaneously

**Smart Project Type Detection** ✅
- ✅ Parallel detection strategy (check all indicators simultaneously)
- ⬜ Weighted scoring system for project type determination
- ✅ Handle polyglot projects (e.g., Node.js frontend + Python backend)
- ⬜ Detect project boundaries in monorepos

### 2. Language Support System ✅

**Pluggable Language Modules** ✅
- ✅ Each language is a self-contained module
- ✅ Modules handle their own command detection and execution
- ✅ Language modules can share common patterns
- ✅ Easy to add new languages without affecting existing ones

**Node.js Module** ✅
- ✅ Package manager detection order: pnpm → yarn → npm
- ✅ Automatic script discovery from package.json
- ⬜ Support for nx, lerna, and other monorepo tools
- ✅ Handle both CommonJS and ESM projects

**Python Module** ✅
- ✅ Environment detection: venv → conda → pyenv → system
- ✅ Package manager detection: poetry → pipenv → pip
- ✅ Framework detection: Django → Flask → FastAPI → generic
- ✅ Handle both Python 2/3 gracefully

### 3. Command Execution Engine ✅

**Intelligent Command Resolution** ✅
- ✅ Commands are abstract until execution time
- ✅ Platform-specific command generation at runtime
- ✅ Automatic path resolution for executables
- ✅ Environment variable injection based on project type

**Cross-Platform Execution** ✅
- ✅ Use native shell on each platform
- ✅ Handle path separators automatically
- ✅ Manage process spawning differently per OS
- ✅ Proper signal handling for all platforms

### 4. User Experience Design

**Natural Language Commands** ✅
- ✅ `run` - Shows available commands with smart categorization
- ✅ `run build` - Executes build in current context
- ✅ `run test --watch` - Passes through arguments naturally
- ⬜ `run python:test` - Explicit language prefix when needed

**Smart Command Discovery** ✅
- ✅ Group by purpose: dev, build, test, deploy, utils
- ✅ Show most relevant commands first
- ✅ Hide internal/utility scripts by default
- ✅ Provide command descriptions from multiple sources

**Intelligent Suggestions** ⬜
- ⬜ Based on file changes (e.g., suggest test after code change)
- ⬜ Based on time patterns (e.g., suggest build before EOD)
- ⬜ Based on error states (e.g., suggest install after missing dependency)
- ⬜ Learn from user patterns over time
