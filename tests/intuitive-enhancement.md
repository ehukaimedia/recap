# Intuitive Session Recovery Enhancement

## Current Problem: Overcomplicated Context

The current implementation tracks too much metadata and not enough **actionable context** for session recovery.

## Intuitive Solution: "Digital Handoff Note"

### Simple Recovery Format:
```
🔄 SESSION HANDOFF
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📍 Working Directory: /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/Recap
📝 Active File: src/recap.ts (line 268, analyzeCurrentState function)
🎯 Current Task: Adding search context tracking to trackTools.ts
🔍 Last Search: "analyzeCurrentState" in /src directory
⚡ Status: Tests passing, ready to commit

🚀 Next Steps:
1. Test search context integration
2. Commit changes with meaningful message
3. Update documentation
```

### Key Principles:

#### 1. **Focus on Actionability**
- Not "what happened" but "what to do next"
- Specific file locations, not just file lists
- Clear task description, not workflow patterns

#### 2. **Essential Tools Priority**
1. **edit_block/write_file**: Capture exact edit location
2. **search_code**: Record what was being investigated  
3. **execute_command**: Note running processes
4. **read_file**: Track analysis context

#### 3. **Simple Data Structure**
```typescript
interface WorkHandoff {
  location: string;           // Current directory
  activeEdit: {               // What's being modified
    file: string;
    line?: number;
    function?: string;
    purpose: string;
  };
  investigation: {            // What's being researched
    lastSearch: string;
    searchPath: string;
    intent: string;
  };
  status: string;             // Current state
  nextAction: string;         // What to do next
}
```

#### 4. **Real Session Timeout Scenario**
When Claude times out mid-task:

**Current Output (Overcomplicated):**
- 244 tool calls across 6 sessions
- Multiple workflow patterns
- 43 files touched
- Complex metadata

**Intuitive Output (Actionable):**
- Working on: recap.ts line 268
- Searching for: analyzeCurrentState implementation
- Next: Test and commit search tracking
- Status: Build successful, tests passing

## Implementation Strategy:

### Phase 1: Simplify Current Output
- Reduce verbose session data
- Focus on last 5 minutes of activity
- Emphasize current edit location

### Phase 2: Add Edit Location Tracking
- Capture line numbers from edit_block
- Track function/method being modified
- Record edit purpose/intent

### Phase 3: Smart Context Summary
- Auto-generate task description from recent activity
- Suggest next steps based on patterns
- Provide status indicators (build success, tests passing)

## Benefits:
- **Fast Recovery**: Instant understanding of current work
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps, not just history
- **Focused**: Essential context only
- **Intuitive**: Reads like a human handoff note
