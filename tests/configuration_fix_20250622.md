CRITICAL CONFIGURATION FIX - INTENT DETECTION ACTIVATION
========================================================
Date: June 22, 2025 - 4:24 PM
Issue: Claude Desktop was using original DesktopCommanderMCP instead of enhanced version

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
Claude Desktop config pointed to: /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/DesktopCommanderMCP/dist/index.js
(Original version WITHOUT intent detection)

SOLUTION APPLIED:
Updated Claude Desktop config to: /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/DesktopCommanderMCP-Recap/dist/index.js
(Enhanced version WITH intent detection)

CONFIG CHANGE:
- Changed desktop-commander server path to enhanced version
- Kept recap server path unchanged
- Backed up configuration change

NEXT STEPS:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è RESTART CLAUDE DESKTOP AGAIN ‚ö†Ô∏è
2. Enhanced version should now be active
3. Intent detection should start working immediately
4. Re-run testing protocol to validate

EXPECTED AFTER RESTART:
üß† Intent: Debug and fix identified error or test failure (reactive) 75%

This was the missing piece - configuration was pointing to wrong version!
